## 🎵 The Theme Song

**"Spiff It"** - A hackathon anthem parody of Devo's 1980 hit "Whip It"

### Original Lyrics (Devo):
```
When a problem comes along
You must whip it
Before the cream sits out too long
You must whip it
When something's going wrong
You must whip it
```

### Our Version (Spiffit):
```
When a SPIFF problem comes along
You must Spiff It!
Before the sales month's gone too long
You must Spiff It!
When your quota's going wrong
You must Spiff It!

Spiff it good! 🎸
```
