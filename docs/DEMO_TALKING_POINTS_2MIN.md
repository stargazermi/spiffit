## 🚨 Backup Talking Points (if demo is slow)

If the demo is taking longer than expected:

> "While this is processing - notice we're using **[model name]** as the orchestrator. You can switch between GPT-5.1, Claude, Llama, etc. on the fly. The system also caches results, so on the second run this takes only **5 seconds** instead of 30."

## 📊 Stats to Have Ready

- **426 opportunities** analyzed in real-time
- **8 top performers** identified
- **15+ AI models** available
- **4 Genie spaces** configured (multi-agent)
- **Built in hackathon timeframe** (days, not weeks)
- **44% faster** than previous version (optimized)

## 🎸 Theme Integration (Optional)

If audience is engaged and you have 10 extra seconds:

> "Our theme song is 'Spiff It' - a parody of Devo's 'Whip It'. When a problem comes along... you must Spiff It! When sales are going wrong... you must Spiff It! 🎵"

*(Only use if time and audience energy permits)*
